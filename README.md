#Overfitting and Regularisors

##Lasso and Ridge(Demonstration of usage of linear regression regularisors such as Lasso and Ridge)

*Overfitting* is an issue where the model predict more accurately on the train data set and fail to generate a reasonable prediction for unseen values/test values compared to the accuracy of prediction on train dataset.

*Regularisors* are used here to address this over fitting issue.There are two types of regularisors Lasso and Ridge.

*Lasso* helps not only to overcome the overfitting but it also helps in feature selection. Lasso give zero weightage to less important features.
